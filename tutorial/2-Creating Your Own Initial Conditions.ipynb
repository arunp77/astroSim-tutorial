    "- __Domain__ (aka Grids): the whole simulation box.\n",
    "- __Block__(aka Zones): group of cells that make up a larger unit so that it is more easily handled. If the code is run in parallel, you could have one processor assigned to be in charge to work on several blocks (specified by iProcs,jProcs,kProcs in flash.par). In FLASH, the default block size in flash is $2^3$ = 8 cells. This means that level 0 in the AMR is 8 cells and so forth.\n",

The alues of these gcs are mostly determined by what the boundary conditions you chose. Generally, you won't have to mess with these when specifying the initial conditions.\n",
