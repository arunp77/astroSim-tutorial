    "- __Block__(aka Zones): group of cells that make up a larger unit so that it is more easily handled. If the code is run in parallel, you could have one processor assigned to be in charge to work on several blocks (specified by iProcs,jProcs,kProcs in flash.par). In FLASH, the default block size in flash is $2^3$ = 8 cells. This means that level 0 in the AMR is 8 cells and so forth.\n",
